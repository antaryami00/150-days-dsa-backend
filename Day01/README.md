# Day 1 – Introduction to Algorithms & Time Complexity

## What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

Example:
Finding the maximum number in a list.

## Why Performance Matters
For small data, almost any solution works.
For large data, inefficient algorithms become unusable.

Example:
- 10 items → works fine
- 1,000,000 items → slow code fails

## What is Time Complexity?
Time complexity describes how the execution time of an algorithm
grows as the input size increases.

We do NOT measure exact time.
We measure growth rate.

## Big-O Notation
Big-O describes the worst-case performance.

Common types:
- O(1)  → Constant time
- O(n)  → Linear time
- O(n²) → Quadratic time

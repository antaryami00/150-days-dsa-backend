# Day 4 – Big-O, Theta & Omega

Ω (Omega) – Best case
Θ (Theta) – Average case
O (Big-O) – Worst case

Worst-case analysis protects systems at scale.

# O (Big-O):

The Ceiling. It describes the Upper Bound. The algorithm will never be slower than this.

# Ω (Big-Omega):

The Floor. It describes the Lower Bound. The algorithm will never be faster than this.

# Θ (Big-Theta):

The Exact Fit. It describes a Tight Bound. The algorithm grows at exactly this rate.

# Linear search:

Best Case: The number is the very first item. (1 operation)
Worst Case: The number is the last item or not there at all. (n operations)
Average Case: The number is somewhere in the middle. (n/2 operations)
